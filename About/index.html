        <h4>My Why</h4>
        <p>I applied to Altschool to seek mastery in cloud engineering. I have been in the cloud space for about a year but yet to make <br>any progress. Joining Altschool is a way that I hope to achieve my goal of becoming an expert in Cloud and DevOps Engineering. <br> I had seen the reviews of the first set of students and how they spoke highly of the the program, hence, I decided to apply.</p>
